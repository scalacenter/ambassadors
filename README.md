# The Scala Center Ambassadors Program
The Ambassador Program is a community initiative designed to amplify the official messaging around Scala, show that it is reasonably easy to pick up, promote Scala as a language, and improve the communication link between the Scala Center and the community. Another objective of the program is to effectively collect people's feedback on the state of things in the community and industry.

## The Ambassador Role
The program introduces the role of an Ambassador that can be assumed by any person from the community, provided they satisfy qualification criteria. The Ambassadors will:

- Be consistently present at their local community events.
- Start new community events if they aren't already happening.
- Be visible to other community members as Ambassadors.
- Be perceived by the other community members as go-to people to find official answers to Scala-related questions and to propagate the feedback to the core team.

The qualification criteria to become an Ambassador are as follows:

- Track record of activity in the community - events, forums, OSS etc.
- No track record of unprofessional behaviour.
- Knowledgeability about Scala and its community.
