# Scala Ambassadors

Scala Ambassadors are leaders and key figures in the Scala community.

Ambassadors have volunteered to work with the Scala Center and the community to:

* promote a positive image of Scala
* help newcomers learn Scala and become part of the community
* improve communication between everyone involved with Scala
* aid and support each other's efforts

## This Repo

This repository is a tool aimed to help the Ambassadors in their community-building activities. It fulfills the following objectives:

- **Knowledge Sharing**. It contains a growing body of resources that Ambassadors use to help each other help others. This, for example, can be materials on how someone can start a new Scala meetup, or become a speaker at one. If one Ambassador already has a good answer to those and other questions, they can share it with the other Ambassadors in this repo.
- **Discussion** of important topics in public. This can be, for example, questions about evolving the Ambassador program itself, which can be discussed in the form of discussions or issues.
- **Organization** and coordination of community events and projects.

## The Ambassador Role

Ambassadors are encouraged to:

- Be present whenever possible at their local community events.
- Start new community events if they aren't already happening.
- Be visible to other community members as Ambassadors.
- Be perceived by the other community members as go-to people to find high quality answers to Scala-related questions
- Relay community feedback to the Scala organization

The Center selects Ambassadors who have:

- Strong knowledge of Scala and its community
- A positive track record of activity in the community - conferences, meetups, forums, chat rooms, open source projects, and so on
- No track record of unprofessional behavior
