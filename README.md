# Scala Ambassadors

Scala Ambassadors are leaders and key figures in the Scala community.

Ambassadors have volunteered to work with the Scala Center and the community to:

* promote a positive image of Scala
* improve communication between everyone involved with Scala
* aid and support each other's efforts

## The Ambassador Role

Ambassadors are encouraged to:

- Be present whenever possible at their local community events.
- Start new community events if they aren't already happening.
- Be visible to other community members as Ambassadors.
- Be perceived by the other community members as go-to people to find high quality answers to Scala-related questions
- Relay community feedback to the Scala organization

The Center selects Ambassadors who have:

- Strong knowledge of Scala and its community
- A positive track record of activity in the community - conferences, meetups, forums, chat rooms, open source projects, and so on
- No track record of unprofessional behavior

Want to be an Ambassador? Please get in touch!
